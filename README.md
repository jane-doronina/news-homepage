### Links

- Live Site URL: [News Homepage](https://fabulous-bunny-7039f6.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript


### What I learned + future focus

The main purpose for completing this project was to practice creating responsive layouts with pure CSS using Grids and Flexbox. The primary challenges included making the optimal layout decisions based on JPEG design files and implementing the toggle for mobile menu with vanilla JS.

In future projects I want to focus on Mobile-first workflow and DRY principle for more maintainable and reusable code.
